# Humane Auth

Common Lisp implementation of the authentication system proposed in Raskin's ["The Humane Interface"](http://www.amazon.com/The-Humane-Interface-Directions-Interactive/dp/0201379376).

A writeup of the thought process can be found [here](http://langnostic.blogspot.ca/2013/12/implementing-humane-authentication.html).

Includes a mildly modified version of the Parts of Speech database from [here](http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/) (thank you, Kevin Atkinson).
